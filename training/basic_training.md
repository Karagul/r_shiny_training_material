# Basic Training

- download R here: https://cran.r-project.org/
- download the free version of Rstudio here: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
- go throught this tutorial https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/
- skim through this book and try out some examples: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/
- Create a GitHub account: https://github.com/ . You may need to install git first
- email me your GitHub username.  My GitHub username is "merlinoa"
- Read the following chapters in Advanced R
   - http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html
   - http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Subsetting.html
   - http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html
- work through this introduction to the dplyr package: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html 
- R is generally not thought of as a language for web development, but that is primarily how we use it.  So watch this video on the basics of web development:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXqTHsPaY0A
- shiny basics: https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/basics.html
- more Shiny basics: https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/ (Dean Attali, the author of this tutorial is one of my clients)
- create a very basic Shiny app and put it on GitHub.  Once complete, email me a link to your Shiny app on GitHub (you can loosely base this first Shiny app off of an Example you find online)
- Reread the 3 above chapters from Advanced R
- Read the Advanced R chapter on functions: http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functions.html
- Read these: https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/ .   This one is particular: https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/persistent-data-storage.html
- create another small Shiny app (this one should be something you come up with yourself and create from scratch), and email be a link to this Shiny app on GitHub.  I am not expecting these Shiny apps to look great or have any sophisticated functionality.  The main goal is for you to put something together that runs, and to get you using GitHub.
